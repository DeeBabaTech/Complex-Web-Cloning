# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

Good day to the great personality reading this, this piece will show a run-through of how I was able to recreate this webpage.

I accepted this challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) and decided to try out what I've learnt so far in web development courses.

Assistance from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) provided me with the opportunity to successfully complete this project. I'll advise that you check the website out for more understanding on web development.

I started with writing out my html tags, from which I began to style the tags based on the layout of the assigned project in its [desktop preview](design/desktop-preview.jpg). It seemed tasking at first but got flexible as time went by.

You can check out a screenshot of my project after the recreation from [design](design/myscreenshot.jpg) which looked very much like the assigned task with responsiveness across all screen pixels.

I learned something crucial about the use of percentage (%) and rem when dealing with resolutions (width & height). There's a great difference in it and I recognized the difference during the course of this challenge.
Here is the recognized difference from my [style](/style.css)

```css
.container {
    width: 28.2rem;
}
.container {
    width: 28.2%;
}  

The difference between the former and the latter is that the former is compatible with all screen resolutions (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and it adjusts automatically since the contents are contained in a container, unlike the latter that isn't compatible with all screen resolutions except for the set resolution.
